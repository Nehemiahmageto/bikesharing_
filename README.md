# NYC Bike Sharing Data Analysis. Is Bike Sharing in Des Moines viable?

## Purpose of the project

This is for use by potential investors of the bike sharing project in Des Moines. The analysis done will show whether or not this is a viable positive project worth investment. Data analysis is done through Tableau and the data visualized for better understanding. This os a written analysis of the data explaining the visualizations and ultimately sharing the conclusion of this analysis.

The source of data for the analysis is the publicly available NYC Citi Bike data located on the Citi Bike Website. 
The data on trip duration is first convered to a datetime format using python's panda module. I used Jupyter Notebook to achieve this and exported a csv file that is uploaded and used in Tableau. This was to help capture the duration of every bike ride and consistently expresses a useable datatype.

### Questions to be answered:

What are the best locations to concentrate beginning efforts for this project?
What is the length of time bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?
What is the gender and user type distribution of potential customers?
What is the avergae bike trip length, thus influence distance between store locations>
What is the checkout time by gender?
How are trips distributed through the week?
How are trips distributed by gender through the week?
How are trips distributed by user type through the week?

## Data Analysis
Let us take a deeper look at the different results concluded from this data.

Table above depicts the most likely starting locations by the users. The areas with larger and darker colors depicts the most likely areas one will take out a bike for use. This will help investors when deciding where to start first to attract as much customers as possible. Strategic marketing will be key in these areas.

Table above shows the time most people spend with the bikes before checking out. We can see most of the users only use the bikes for 5 minutes with the graph gradually falling thereafter. Most users will have checked out in twenty five minutes with the outliers spreading out till the hour with very few extending thereafter.
This coupled with the best starting locations, we can conclude that offices well spaced out within five to twenty minues of each other would be ideal in these areas to cater for all users within this area. The offices can spread out with longer distances as we head into the least best starting locations.
