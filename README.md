# NYC Bike Sharing Data Analysis. Is Bike Sharing in Des Moines viable?

## Purpose of the project

This is for use by potential investors of the bike sharing project in Des Moines. The analysis done will show whether or not this is a viable positive project worth investment. Data analysis is done through Tableau and the data visualized for better understanding. This os a written analysis of the data explaining the visualizations and ultimately sharing the conclusion of this analysis.

The source of data for the analysis is the publicly available NYC Citi Bike data located on the Citi Bike Website. 
The data on trip duration is first convered to a datetime format using python's panda module. I used Jupyter Notebook to achieve this and exported a csv file that is uploaded and used in Tableau. This was to help capture the duration of every bike ride and consistently expresses a useable datatype.

### Questions to be answered:

What are the best locations to concentrate beginning efforts for this project?
What is the length of time bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?
What is the gender and user type distribution of potential customers?
What is the avergae bike trip length, thus influence distance between store locations>
What is the checkout time by gender?
How are trips distributed through the week?
How are trips distributed by gender through the week?
How are trips distributed by user type through the week?
